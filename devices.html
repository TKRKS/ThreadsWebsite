				<h1>Devices</h1>
				<p>
More and more electronic devices have computers these days.  They can be found it thermostats, cars, cell phones, calculators and more.  These devices have considerable hardware limitations that programmers must keep in mind when writing programs for these computers to use.  This limitation is what the Devices thread is all about.
				<br/>
				<br/>
The Devices thread teaches students about limited computer hardware and how to program on these computers considering the limitations.  Students will learn specifics about how computer hardware works.  They may learn how to smartly program for mobile devices like phones which have major limitations on memory.  They could even learn how to program for robots that will need to operate on their own with similar limitations.  All this and more are taught in the Devices thread.
				<br/>
				<br/>
Many types of students will enjoy the Devices thread.  Out of all the threads, Devices is the most hardware heavy.  This means that fans of computer engineering and low level programming will greatly enjoy this thread.  In addition, students who want to be programming for the cutting edge of commercial computers will like this thread, as limited computers like smart phones are becoming increasingly popular.

				<h1>Devices</h1>
				<p>Computers are everywhere.  From desktops to cell phones to thermostats, most modern electronics have some kind of computer inside of them.  These devices tend to have very limited hardware and present a big challenge for programmers trying to make them run correctly.  This is where the Devices thread comes in handy.  In Devices, you will learn both how to program computers to use their hardware directly, but also learn how to efficiently program these so you don't make a program the device can't handle.  If you enjoy low level programming and working directly with limited computer hardware, Devices may be the thread for you.</p>

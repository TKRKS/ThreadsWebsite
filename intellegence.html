				<h1>Intellegence</h1>
				<p>Since they were first invented, computers have quickly become incredibly intelligent.  Modern computer programs can learn, adapt, and make rational decisions, ranging from beating the world chess champion to simply allowing a robot to move around a room it has never been in before.  All these amazing things are possible due to artificial intelligence- the field of making computers act rationally.  The Intelligence thread will teach you how to create these smart programs.

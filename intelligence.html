				<h1>Intelligence</h1>
				<p>Since they were first invented, computers have quickly become incredibly intelligent.  Modern computer programs can learn, adapt, and make rational decisions, ranging from beating the world chess champion to simply allowing a robot to move around a room it has never been in before.  All these amazing things are possible due to artificial intelligence- the field of making computers act rationally.  The Intelligence Thread will teach you how to create these smart programs.
               <br/>
               <br/>
Intelligence is all about making computers think and action rationally.  You may learn how a computer can take a pile of data and use it to make better decisions in the future.  You could learn how to create programs that can play games against both humans and other programs.  You may even learn about how humans perceive the world.  All of this and more is taught in the Intelligence Thread.
               <br/>
               <br/>
There are many kinds of people who may enjoy the Intelligence Thread.  Anyone interested in how people think will enjoy all the psychology classes that are the foundation of the Thread.  Fans of logic will enjoy learning about how to make computers think and act rationally.  In addition, the simple idea of intelligent robots and computers is often enough to attract many students to this Thread.</p>

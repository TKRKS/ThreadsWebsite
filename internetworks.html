				<h1>Information Internetworks</h1>
				<p>
The Internet has become a major part of our everyday lives.  More and more electronic devices are being hooked up to the Internet and given networking capabilities.  In fact, many industries exist today that would not even be possible without the Internet.  There are a lot of individual parts that are combined together that make the Internet possible.  These parts of the Internet are the basis of the Information Internetworks Thread.
               <br/>
               <br/>
The Information Internetworks Thread deals with the Internet and how it works.  For example, you could learn computer networking, which explains how data is transmitted between different computers.  Maybe youâ€™d like to learn about databases which store the massive amounts of data found online.  Perhaps you are interested in information security and how to transport sensitive information between computers safely.  All of these topics and more can be found in the Information Internetworks Thread.
               <br/>
               <br/>
Many people will find things to like about the Information Internetworks Thread.  Obviously, fans of the Internet will enjoy learning how it works and how to make successful programs that run on multiple computers.  In addition, fans of low level programming will enjoy this Thread.  While there is not quite as much low level programming as the Devices or Systems and Architecture Threads, there is still a lot that relies on computer hardware (especially in the computer networking and information security classes).

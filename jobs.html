						<h3> 
							Compiler Writer
						</h3>
						<p>
Without programming languages, it would be so incredibly difficult to program for computers that they very likely wouldn’t be in widespread use today.  Compiler Writers are the people that translate from the high level programming languages that allow people to do so much to the low level instructions that the computer can actually understand.   Compiler Writers need the Systems and Architecture and Theory Thread to do this.  The Systems and Architecture Thread will help you understand computer hardware and how to actually tell the computer directly to do things using low level instructions.  The Theory Thread is necessary to be able to figure out how actually translate from the high level programming levels to the low level instructions using many different kind of state machines.

						<h3> 
							Computer Architect
						</h3>
						<p>
							Computer Architecture is the process of designing computer hardware and how they run.  A Computer Architect is the person who actually plans out how hardware will run on a computer and the instructions that can be used to run them.  Since a Computer Architect works so closely with computer hardware, they will find the Devices and Systems and Architecture Threads most useful.  The Devices Thread has many computer engineering classes that will teach you about how computer hardware works and is built, which will be needed to make design decisions.  The Systems and Architecture Thread will teach you how this hardware will interact with the software being run on it, so that the Computer Architect can make design decisions that will allow the computer to run as smoothly as possible.

						<h3> 
							Database Administrator 
						</h3>
						<p>
Database Administrators set up and run databases for various companies and agencies.  They spend their time designing and implementing the logical database layout (like the tables and schemas) as well as managing the back end to ensure the database runs as quickly and efficiently as possible.  This job lends itself to two Threads- Information Internetworks and Systems and Architecture.  In Information Internetworks, there are multiple classes that focus completely on the logical database layout as well as the back end part of the database.  As database efficiency deals directly with the operating systems and the underlying computer architecture, the Systems and Architecture Thread will give you the background needed to run a database as efficiently as possible.

						<h3> Mobile Developer </h3>
						<p>
Mobile Developers create programs that are run on phones and other small devices.  Whether they are a simple calendar system or apps for popular websites, Mobile Developers must always focus on both the limited hardware they have to work with and the that that the phones are always on the move.  Mobile Developers will find the Devices and the Information Internetworks Threads most useful.  The Devices Thread teaches you how to write programs that are designed specifically to run on limited hardware.  The Information Internetworks Thread will teach you how to stay connected to a mobile device that is always on the move (which is much harder than it sounds).

						<h3> Operating Systems Designer </h3>
						<p>
Operating Systems are some of the largest and most complicated programs in existence.  As such, working on them is a very specialized job.  Operating Systems Designers develop and add on to operating systems that take care of the computer hardware so other programs don’t have to worry.  The Systems and Architecture Thread is perfect for an Operating Systems Designer.  This entire Thread is focused on computer hardware and its interaction with computer software (in fact, Operating System Design is one of the main classes for the Thread), as such it will be a great help for an Operating System Designer.

						<h3> Roboticist </h3>
						<p>
Roboticists design, build and program robots that do all kinds of different tasks.  Whether they are working on simple robots that work on assembly lines or soccer playing robots, Roboticist must be familiar with the computer hardware necessary to build the robots as well as the algorithms needed for the robot to run on its own.  The two most useful Threads for a Roboticist would be Devices and Intelligence.  The Devices Thread will teach you about the computer hardware and how to write programs that work with very limited hardware (which is useful because robots may not be able to fit a full scale computer within them).  The Intelligence Thread will teach you about algorithms which will allow the robot to work autonomously without input from the Roboticist.

						<h3> Security Specialist </h3>
						<p>
Security Specialists are the heroes of the computer world.  They work to stop hackers, virus and more from hurting people and their computers too much.  Since hackers target a wide variety of computers and programs, Information Security Specialists must both understand how the internals of computers and the internet works.  As such, the best Threads for this kind of job would be Information Internetworks and Systems and Architecture.  In Information Internetworks, you will learn both the basics of information security that can protect information both on and between computers, and how the internet works so you are aware how viruses can transfer themselves.  In addition, since virus often target bugs deep in the operating system code, the Systems and Architecture Thread will give you a good basis necessary to combat these attacks.

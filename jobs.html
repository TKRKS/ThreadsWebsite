						<h3> 
							Compiler Writer
						</h3>
						<p>
Without programming languages, it would be so incredibly difficult to program for computers that they likely wouldn’t be in widespread use today.  Compiler Writers are the people that translate from the high level programming languages that allow people easily create programs to the low level instructions that the computer can actually understand.   Compiler Writers need the Systems and Architecture and Theory Thread to do this.  The Systems and Architecture Thread will help you understand both computer hardware and how to tell the computer directly to do tasks using assembly language instructions.  The Theory Thread is necessary to be able to figure out how actually translate from the high level programming languges to the low level instructions using state machines.

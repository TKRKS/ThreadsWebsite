				<h1>Modeling and Simulation</h1>
				<p>One of the earliest uses of computers was to run simulations to test theories in different scientific fields.  Since computers have become more popular, so has the use of computers for various kinds of simulations.  From weather prediction to the projected affects of a government projects, computer models and simulations are used all the time to test policy and predict the future in many different fields.  In the Modeling and Simulation thread, you will learn how to create and run these kinds of models to help people in different fields.  You may enjoy this thread if you are interested in using computers to help people in other math heavy fields.</p>

				<h1>Modeling and Simulation</h1>
				<p>One of the earliest uses of computers was simulations.  These simulations were used to help scientists test theories they had developed about how the world works.  As computers have become more common and more powerful, they have also become increasingly used to run different simulations.  From weather to the stock market, computer simulations are used to predict what will happen in the future by using various models.  The Modeling and Simulation thread will teach you how to run theses kind of simulations correctly and efficiently.  
               <br/>
               <br/>
The Modeling and Simulation thread is all about how to create and run simulations using computers.  You may specific techniques to create modules to run well on a computer.  You may also learn how to work with extremely powerful machines (as the computers that run these simulations are much more powerful than standard desktop computers).  You may even learn how computers can predict things using massive amounts of existing data.  All this and more will be taught in the Modeling and Simulation thread.
               <br/>
               <br/>
Many different people will enjoy the Modeling and Simulation thread.  Fans of math will enjoy learning about how to create these models and the statistics behind them.  People who are interested in using computers in various other fields will find that this thread can be very easily applied to any other field out there.  In addition, fans of high performance computing may be surprised about how much they enjoy this thread, as these simulations must be run efficiently on powerful machines if they are to have any chance of finishing.</p>

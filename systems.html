				<h1>Systems and Architecture</h1>
				<p>Computers are complex machines.  There are many strange parts that interact with each other that allow a computer work work.  Computers, however, can not work unless they are told specifically what to do.  People must write programs that tell the computer where to save things or when to do specific tasks.  This is what the Systems and Architecture thread deals with-
               <br/>
               <br/>
The Systems and Architecture thread is about the interaction between computer hardware and software.  For example, you will learn about operating systems and how they make sure in:inboxcomputer hardware is working as efficiently as possible.  In addition, you will learn about assembly languages and how programs run from the hardwareâ€™s point of view.  You may also learn about compilers and how they use tricks to make code run smoother on specific hardware.
               <br/>
               <br/>
There are many reasons someone may enjoy the Systems and Architecture thread.  Students who are interested in learning how a computer works will enjoy all all the low level classes that deal with this topic.  In addition, fans of low level programming languages will feel right at home, as this thread almost exclusively uses C. </p>

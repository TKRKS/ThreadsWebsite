				<h1>Systems and Architecture</h1>
				<p>Computer hardware can be difficult to work with.  Programs interact with this hardware in many different ways that can be challenging for programmers to make efficient.  The Systems and Architecture thread is all about this low-level programming and the interaction between computer hardware and software.  In this thread, you will learn how many programs that interact with the hardware (like operating systems and compilers) work.  You may enjoy this thread if you like low-level programming and want to know how typical computers work. </p>

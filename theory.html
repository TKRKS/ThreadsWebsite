				<h1>Theory</h1>
				<p>Why do computer programs work?  How can we make them faster and more efficient?  When you boil computing down to its core, what you are left with is math.  This math forms the basis for modern programs and can be used to prove that one particular program is faster than another.  The Theory Thread is all about this math.
               <br/>
               <br/>
The Theory Thread is about the math and algorithms that form the basis for all computing.  You will learn about algorithms and common ways to solve recurring problems.  You could learn about graphs and the theory that goes with it.  You may also learn all kinds of complex math like number theory and combinatorics.  All this and more can be learned in the Theory Thread.
               <br/>
               <br/>
Many different types of people may enjoy the theory Thread.  Fans of math will enjoy the high level math classes that are taught as part of the theory Thread.  In addition, students who care more about why a particular program works rather than how to use it on a specific computer will find themselves right at home in this Thread.</p>
